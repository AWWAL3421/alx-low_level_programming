To reserve enough space in memory to copy the string "Best School," the following statements would be valid:

malloc(sizeof("Best School") + 1): This statement allocates memory based on the size of the string literal "Best School" plus an additional byte for the null terminator.

malloc(strlen("Best School")): This statement allocates memory based on the length of the string literal "Best School" (excluding the null terminator). However, it should be noted that this statement does not allocate space for the null terminator, which is required for proper string handling.

malloc(11): This statement directly allocates memory for the given number of bytes, which is the length of the string "Best School" without the null terminator.

malloc(sizeof("Best School")): This statement allocates memory based on the size of the string literal "Best School," which includes the null terminator.

malloc(12): This statement directly allocates memory for the given number of bytes, which is the length of the string "Best School" plus one byte for the null terminator.

malloc(strlen("Best School") + 1): This statement allocates memory based on the length of the string literal "Best School" plus one additional byte for the null terminator.

So, the valid statements to reserve enough space for the string "Best School" would be:

malloc(sizeof("Best School") + 1)
malloc(strlen("Best School") + 1)
malloc(12) 
still a wrong answer
